Tic-Tac-Toe, otherwise known as noughts and crosses, is a game played on a 3x3 grid where one player is represented with Xs and the other is represented with Os. The X player puts a mark in one of the nine grid locations. The O player then selects one of the eight remaining grid locations. The game continues until either one player gets three in a row or diagonally.
